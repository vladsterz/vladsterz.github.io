## Greetings and welcome
For some time now I've been thinking 
of making a blog where I could document tech stuff 
I've learnt over time and share with people and ( since my memory is as leak-proof 
as your first C program ) my futute self. My posts will probably wander among topics like 
**C++ performance code issues**, **graphics** and **computer vision**. 

Hopefully I will be able to suppress my inner nerd from time to time and be able to write on some other topics too.
Probably something about **hiking**, **rock climbing**, **dogs**, **life**, **philosophy**, **love**, **robots** and whatever I fancy.
Now that I am thinking about it again, hopefully I will write.

## Who am I (in the office)
My name is [Vladimiros Sterzentsenko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=el&user=bUPd1SUAAAAJ) and I work as a computer vision / machine learning engineer. I've been around for some time to see the rise
of the CNNs , transformers , GANs , stable diffusion and eventually the ~~beggining of the end~~ LLMs. I've got a huge experience 
on [multi-camera systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-camera_setup), [depth cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map),
calibration algorithms, and [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing) and [3D reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction) (and many more that I dont even remember).

## Who am I (out of the office)
My name is Vlad, a proud ~~owner of~~ roomate with a pure crossbreed, ex-street dog named [Rhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(mythology)) (I just realized that there is a silent 'h' in the name). We really enjoy going for long hikes and in general being anywhere away from the city. I really enjoy rock climbing, chess, basketball and cooking. Hopefully I will have some posts here about any of that stuff.
